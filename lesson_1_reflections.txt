How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- Go back after experimentation/errors.
- Working in different directions from previous verisons

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
- Automatic saving will give a large number of comits, including non working code
- Manually may be long apart, but will have working code. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is use for code while Google docs are for documents. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows when things were changed with a description
git diff shows what was changed between two commits
